# Style.tf source code

Comprises of:
  - **web**, the Next.js frontend
  - **crawler**, a small script that populates the player collection
  - **analyser**, a script that automatically generates the usage data

The code within the styletf package is only for crawler/analyser, because of weird import issues it has to be duplicated for the Next.js project
